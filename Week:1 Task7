7) Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:
PROGRAM:
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {

            if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
                minPrice = prices[i];
            } else {
                int profit = prices[i] - minPrice;
                if (profit > maxProfit) {
                    maxProfit = profit;
                }
            }
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
}


OUTPUT:
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
